ReXGlue converts Xbox 360 PowerPC code into portable C++ that runs natively on modern platforms.

ReXGlue is heavily rooted on the foundations of [Xenia](https://github.com/xenia-project), the Xbox 360 emulator. Rather than interpreting or JIT-compiling PPC instructions at runtime, ReXGlue takes a different path: it generates C++ source code ahead of time, an approach inspired by [XenonRecomp](https://github.com/hedge-dev/XenonRecomp) and [rexdex's recompiler](https://github.com/rexdex/recompiler).

Latest SDK builds and releases are published on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk/releases). Join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/CNTxwSNZfT) for updates and support.

## Example Projects

- [demo-iruka](https://github.com/rexglue/demo-iruka)
- [reblue](https://github.com/rexglue/reblue)

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites (non-Visual Studio users only)

- Clang 20
- CMake
- Ninja
- [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
- Latest Release from [Releases](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk/releases)

### Installing the SDK
Download the latest release and extract it to a location of your choice. This will be your `REXSDK` path. Set this as an environment variable using your preferred method.

#### Building from source

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk
cd rexglue
cmake --preset <platform>
cmake --build out/build/<platform> --target install
```

This will perform a multi-config build and put the SDK at `out/install/<platform>`. You may move this folder and then set this path on your environment variable as `REXSDK` using your preferred method (system or CMakeUserPresets.json in your target project).


### Creating a project

```bash
rexglue init --app_name [project name] --app_root [project root path]
```

This generates a project with `CMakeLists.txt`, `CMakePresets.json`, and starter source files.


Ensure the install path of the SDK is correctly set as an environment variable `REXSDK`.

### Project configuration

The `rexglue init` command generates a `<project>_config.toml` file that controls the codegen pipeline. Run codegen with:

```bash
rexglue codegen <project>_config.toml
```

#### Required fields

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `project_name` | Name used for generated output files |
| `file_path` | Path to the Xbox 360 XEX or ELF binary |
| `out_directory_path` | Directory for generated C++ code (default: `generated`) |

#### Code generation options

These control how PPC registers and instructions are translated to C++. All default to `false`.

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `skip_lr` | Skip link register saves/restores. Reduces generated code for leaf functions. |
| `skip_msr` | Skip MSR (Machine State Register) instructions. |
| `ctr_as_local` | Emit CTR (Count Register) as a local variable instead of reading/writing thread state. Reduces memory traffic in loops. |
| `xer_as_local` | Emit XER (Integer Exception Register) as a local variable. |
| `cr_as_local` | Emit CR (Condition Register) fields as local variables. Significant codegen improvement for branch-heavy code. |
| `reserved_as_local` | Emit reserved registers (r1, r2, r13) as local variables. |
| `non_argument_as_local` | Emit non-argument volatile registers (r11-r12) as local variables. |
| `non_volatile_as_local` | Emit non-volatile registers (r14-r31) as local variables. Only safe when the function's save/restore behavior is well understood. |
| `generate_exception_handlers` | Generate SEH exception handler wrappers. Can also be enabled at the CLI with `--enable_exception_handlers`. |

#### Special addresses

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `setjmp_address` | Address of the `setjmp` function in the binary. Required for correct non-local jump handling. |
| `longjmp_address` | Address of the `longjmp` function in the binary. |

#### Analysis tuning (`[analysis]` section)

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `max_jump_extension` | `65536` | Maximum bytes to extend a function when following jump table targets. |
| `data_region_threshold` | `16` | Consecutive invalid instructions before marking a region as embedded data. |
| `large_function_threshold` | `1048576` | Byte threshold for "large function" warnings. |
| `exception_handler_funcs` | `[]` | Array of addresses for exception handler functions beyond auto-detected ones. |

#### Manual function overrides (`[functions]` section)

Define function boundaries, names, or parent-child relationships when auto-detection gets it wrong:

```toml
[functions]
# Name a function
0x82000000 = { name = "MyFunction" }

# Explicit size (bytes)
0x82000100 = { size = 64 }

# Explicit end address (exclusive)
0x82000200 = { end = 0x82000280 }

# Discontinuous chunk belonging to a parent function
0x82000300 = { parent = 0x82000000, size = 32 }
```

Fields: `name`, `size`, `end` (mutually exclusive with `size`), `parent` (makes it a chunk of another function).

#### Switch tables (`[[switch_tables]]`)

Manually define switch/jump tables when auto-detection fails:

```toml
[[switch_tables]]
address = 0x82000000    # Address of the bctr instruction
register = 11           # GPR used as the jump index
labels = [0x82000100, 0x82000200, 0x82000300]  # Branch target addresses
```

#### Mid-asm hooks (`[[midasm_hook]]`)

Inject calls to native C++ functions at specific instruction addresses:

```toml
[[midasm_hook]]
address = 0x82000000
name = "MyHook"
registers = ["r3", "r4"]       # Registers passed to the hook function
after_instruction = false       # Insert before (false) or after (true) the instruction

# Control flow after hook (pick one):
# return = true                 # Return from the function after the hook
# jump_address = 0x82001000     # Jump to a different address after the hook

# Conditional control flow (hook returns bool):
# return_on_true = true
# return_on_false = true
# jump_address_on_true = 0x82001000
# jump_address_on_false = 0x82002000
```

#### Invalid instruction hints (`[[invalid_instructions]]`)

Mark data patterns that the disassembler misidentifies as code:

```toml
[[invalid_instructions]]
data = 0x12345678   # The raw instruction word
size = 4            # Size of the data region in bytes
```
